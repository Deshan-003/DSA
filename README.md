## **Smart City & Algorithm Performance Suite**

A menu-driven, console-based Java application designed to integrate graph-based route planning, sorting algorithm comparisons, and time complexity analysis.

### Project Overview

This project consists of three integrated modules that demonstrate the practical application of fundamental data structures and algorithms.

### 1. Smart City Route Planner

A module that models urban geography using Graphs (Adjacency List/Matrix).

**Location Management:** Uses a tree structure (AVL/BST) to store locations before mapping them to the graph.

**Road Connectivity:** Allows users to add or remove roads (edges) and display all connections.

**Traversal:** Implements stacks or queues for route listing operations.


### 2. Data Sorter (Algorithm Comparison Tool)

A tool to visualize and compare the efficiency of different sorting techniques.

**Sorting Algorithms:** Includes Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

**Datasets:** Supports manual entry 

**Metrics:** Displays sorted output and execution time for each algorithm in a performance table.


### 3. Algorithm Performance Analyzer

Focuses on the empirical analysis of time complexity across varying input sizes.

**Searching:** Implements Linear or Binary Search.

**Analysis:** Measures execution time using System.nanoTime() for datasets ranging from 100 to 1,000 elements.

**Reporting:** Summarizes results in a tabular format for easy comparison.
